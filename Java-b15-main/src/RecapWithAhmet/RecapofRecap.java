    /*
    -->Java --> JDK JVM JRE

    -->Primitive --> opposite of Advance -->storing -> no methods

    -->ASCIITABLE --> Character --> char letter='g' int letter='g'-->103

    -->String and Methods--> Object --> substring, trim, contains, replace
      equals

    -->IfAndTernary --> if(condition) --> else if(condition)

    -->if(a>b)    boolean result= a>b ? true: false

      else{

    -->Switch --> good example --> Bank calling system, ATM system

        switch(data/value)

          case data/value
          break;

     -->Loops --> reverse the digits , taking first letters last letters
        -->iteration the data one by one
        for(int i=0; i<word.length();i+3) i--
         -->Do while --> AT LEAST ONCE IT WILL RUN
         -->WHILE --> it will check the condition and execute code
         -->for And ForEach -->It will iterate the data with the condition
     NOTE:Every loop type must have either "BREAK" or Increment/decrement


     -->Arrays: is a bucket(storage) for primitives and Objects. -->Limited data

         -->Fixed, multidimensional,it has only one fuction(length) ..etc

         -->loops or you can directly assign --> word[0]

         -->Split --> It return String[] -->can be used for any purposes.

      -->Object-Methods-->

        -->Class --> is a template/blueprint of the object

         --> Object-->is a representation of class

         -->Methods --> actions, behaviors

       -->Constructor-->

         -->It is a way to initiliaze your instance variables

          --> Constructor can be overloaded not overridden

          -->Constructor can have constructor inside --> this()

          -->Constructor must have same name of class and no return type

        -->Garbage Collector-->   It is a way to clean unused/useless data in your system

         --> it will help to improve your system, it will reduce the amount of memory usage

            -->Finalize -->override

        -->Wrapper Class --> It is a way to convert the data to different forms

         -->Efficiency , --> Autoboxing and Unboxing -->

         Autoboxing --> primitive --> Object

         Unboxing --> Object -->primitive

        -->MultiDimensional Array: Difference between array and arraylist -->

            String[][] --> 2 dimensional --> String[][][] --->3

        LIST --> List is a part of collection (storage for Objects) -->MAY ACCEPT DUPLICATES

          -->ArrayList -->reach out the data in arraylist --> it is faster
          -->LinkedList -->whenever you do manipulation(removing,inserting...etc) -->it is faster

        SET --> Set is all about UNIQUENESS

           --->HashSet --> random order
           --->LinkedSet -->insertion order
           --->TreeSet -->Ascending order

       QUEUE --> You can say that --> I am not familiar with this type but I heard that it is part of collection

       MAP --> Because it has a different usage of it --> KEY AND VALUE -->

       SHOW OFF:It is actually combination of LIST AND SET. The KEY part of the map refers to SET(BECAUSE IT IS UNIQUE)
              The VALUE part of the map refers to LIST(MIGHT ACCEPT DUPLICATES)

       STATIC-INSTANCE BLOCK -->

             --> STATIC AS A VARIABLE : instance variable --> FIRST --> TO access the variable without creating an object
                                                              SECOND --> To make the variable SHAREABLE --> COMMON(FAMILY MONEY ACCOUNT)

             -->STATIC AS A KEYWORD: methods --> To access the methods without creating an object

             -->STATIC AS A BLOCK: block -->It will give you advantage to execute the implementation FIRST and ONCE. (BANK OF AMERICA)

                IN AUTOMATION --> @BEFORE

        INSTANCE BLOCK --> Is a way to execute the code as many as objects you create.
